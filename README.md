#General Thoughts/Things to elaborate
We obviously need to pull in the Google Maps API. How do we achieve this?
Our data structure.
Our pages that we will have.
will we be using authentication?
what will the objects that we will have consist of?
what will our store look like?
how will data flow from each page?
Talk to caitlin about what her overall vision about the site.
We will need to delegate jobs to everyone. how will our time be organised?
